As an AI language model myself, I can provide you with some examples of tools that use OpenAI's technology:
OpenAI GPT-3: OpenAI's latest and most advanced language model, capable of natural language generation, language translation, summarization, and more.
OpenAI Codex: an AI system that can understand and generate code in multiple programming languages.
OpenAI API: a cloud-based API that allows developers to access OpenAI's language models and other AI services.
GPT-2 Playground: a web-based tool that lets you experiment with OpenAI's GPT-2 language model by generating text and completing prompts.
Hugging Face Transformers: a library of pre-trained language models, including those developed by OpenAI, that can be used for various natural language processing tasks.
GPT-3 Sandbox: a web-based tool that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
